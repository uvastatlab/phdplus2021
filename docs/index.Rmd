The [UVA Library's](https://www.library.virginia.edu) [Research Data Services](https://data.library.virginia.edu) is partnering with UVA's [PhDPlus program](http://phdplus.virginia.edu/) to present Data Literacy in R, a four-session series to build data wrangling and visualization skills.

This site will host the materials for the series.

<br>

## Schedule
* Dates: Wednesdays, 2/10, 2/17, 2/27, 3/3
* Time: 2:00 - 4:00 p.m.
* Place: Virtual Zoom meetings

Register for the series through the [PhDPlus events pages](https://phdplus.virginia.edu/core-modules/156/111). Upon successful completion of this series (at least 3 out of 4 sessions), PhD students will be eligible for PhD Plus “Data Literacy in R” non-credit credentials on transcripts. These credentials are UVA-endorsed, and are a good opportunity to show demonstrated interest and knowledge in basic data science skills to prospective employers. You may register for individual sessions, though the sessions are cumulative, so understanding of the material in the prior session is assumed. If registration exceeds the registration cap (15), preference will be given to individuals who've signed up for four or more sessions.




## Sessions

#### **Introduction to R**
[Wednesday, 2/10/2021](https://phdplus.virginia.edu/events/phd-data-literacy-r-1-introduction)   
Instructor: Jenn Huck

R is a free, open-source software environment and programming language designed specifically for statistical analysis; RStudio is a free, open source integrated development environment (IDE) for R that provides a friendly interface for viewing graphs, data tables, R code, and output all at the same time. This first session provides a gentle introduction to R and RStudio. We’ll get started navigating R with RStudio, loading libraries, and importing data. We’ll do some basic data manipulation and exploration and cover some key practices and shortcuts for using R effectively and helpful resources for learning more.

#### **Data Wrangling and Exploration **
[Wednesday, 2/17/2021](https://phdplus.virginia.edu/events/phd-data-literacy-r-2-data-wrangling-and-exploration)   
Instructor: Michele Claibourn

Before analyzing data, we spend considerable effort exploring the data – understanding patterns, checking for missingness -- and wrangling the into an analyzable form – creating and recoding variables, merging data sets, reshaping data. This session will cover the dplyr and tidyr packages for data manipulation and analysis, like conditionally computing summary statistics over subsets of interest. The session will assume understanding of the material in the preceding sessions and will build on a common research case, using Albemarle Real Estate Property data (though each workshop may also introduce additional examples and data).



#### **Data Visualization**
[Wednesday, 2/24/2021](https://phdplus.virginia.edu/events/phd-data-literacy-r-3-data-visualization)    
Instructor: Clay Ford

Exploring our data with graphs allows us to visualize relationships, spot unusual observations, or find unexpected patterns. In this session we introduce how to effectively use the ggplot2 package to explore and visualize data in R. With its consistent syntax and layered approach to making graphics, ggplot2 has revolutionized data visualization. What previously would have required hours of tedious programming can now be accomplished in a few lines of ggplot2 code. This session will introduce the logic behind ggplot2, how to use ggplot2 to explore your data, and how to customize and polish ggplot2 graphs. The session will assume understanding of the material in the preceding sessions and will build on a common research case, using Albemarle Real Estate Property data (though each workshop may also introduce additional examples and data).



#### **Reporting and Presenting Data using R Markdown**
[Wednesday, 3/3/2021](https://phdplus.virginia.edu/events/phd-data-literacy-r-4-reporting-and-presenting-data-using-r-markdown)   
Instructor: Clay Ford

After we explore, summarize and visualize our data, we likely need to present our findings to an audience. This may be a document, a web page, a slide deck, or even a dashboard. Using R Markdown we can combine R code with narration to quickly create professional reports and presentations, all within RStudio. This means we don't need to copy-and-paste results or plots into another application. We can analyze and write about our data all at once and let RStudio generate the plots and tables. In this final session we'll get you up-and-running with R Markdown so you can create high quality documents, reports, presentations and more.
